I can add more if you need, [open a **new** issue](https://github.com/EmmanuelBeziat/vscode-great-icons/issues) to ask which extension you want.

Enjoy ☺

> Wow, we reached 120k downloads… You’ve made my little set one of the most used by VSC community (well, really far behind the first, but still!). Thanks for your support! You’re amazing. ♥

## How to use

After installation and activation, you should go in settings (`File` → `Preferences` on Windows, or `Code` → `Preferences` on OSX), choose `File Icon Theme`, and select `VSCode Great Icons`.
